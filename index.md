# COMPLIANCE APPLICATION

## INTRODUCTION
The Government of Botswana has recently introduced new laws that regulate the number of
people that gather in institutions as a compliance measure. This has led to confusion in the
general public as some people can travel to such institutions only to find out that they are
already filled up and they cannot be allowed to get in. This has also contributed to making
people leave their homes early so as to make sure that they get a seat/space which in most
cases affects the time they take to prepare themselves before they leave. It has also to some
institutions bending the laws by allowing a few extra people to get in out of sympathy for the
time they took to travel and law enforcement officers being unaware of this as they cannot
remotely monitor the number of people in these institutions.

## AIM
To make a mobile application that can be used by the general public to reserve spaces in
institutions that have a limited population and also to report non-compliance.

## OBJECTIVES
* Registered users should be able to login

* Unregistered users should be able to create accounts

* Logged in users should select an institution category

* Users should be able to reserve a spot
* Return a unique reservation if there is space and tell users if there is no space 
* Users should be able to report non-compliance acts observed

## LITERATURE REVIEW
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
coronavirus. The virus that causes COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified
during an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China in 2019. Since then, the virus has
spread to more than 100 countries, including our country Botswana. The virus is spread mainly
from person-to-person through close contact with one another (less than 1- 2 meters apart),
Respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes and also touching a
surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly
their eyes[1]. The virus currently has no cure and it claimed over half a million lives worldwide
making it a national threat[2].
The virus has thus changed the normal way in which the operate/behave in institutions, it has
brought about new laws being made to try and enforce compliance in different institutions so
as to reduce the spread of the virus. Institutions are defined as organizations founded for a
religious, educational, professional, or social purpose[3]. These different types institutions
encourage the gathering of people and thus the rapid spread of the virus in case one person
might be unknowingly infected.
It has also led to the development of many compliance applications in various countries.

Connected Life created a scalable COVID-19 case remote monitoring, reporting and compliance
solution to help our population. Optimized for the Fitbit Versa 2 and with emphasis on
supporting the needs of healthcare workers, patients and their families, essential workers and
community volunteers. It is available in Singapore and other selected APAC territories and in
Europe and USA in June 2020 (GDPR and HIPPA compliance for Europe and USA by June 2020).

### Strengths
* Mass Remote Monitoring & Compliance
* Easy to onboard and use

### Weakeness
* Not available in certain parts of the wold

## TECHNOGOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN BOTSWANA
In all the villages, towns, and cities across Botswana, many adolescents, adults, and elderly
people own and use a mobile phone. Local networks have continued to extend mobile phone
signals and mobile-enabled services countrywide, while the Botswana government has
committed itself to networking the villages that have been underserved by the local networks.
Subsequently, young people in Botswana adopt mobile phones, as the devices promise them
extensive access public and social services as well access to the internet[4].
Currently there is no known compliance application in Botswana that is being used to make
sure that different institutions comply with the new set laws to combat COVID-19. There is no
any form of technology which helps different institutions to control the number of people that
come or gather in their institutions.
Population of people is controlled manually in different institutions without the use of any
advanced technology. They count the number of people that get in and if the population
exceeds 75 some people will have to be sent back. If Institutions do not comply the only way
law enforcement officers will know either by complaint call from the public or if they are doing
a survey to ensure compliance.
