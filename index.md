# COMPLIANCE APPLICATION

## INTRODUCTION
The Government of Botswana has recently introduced new laws that regulate the number of
people that gather in institutions as a compliance measure. This has led to confusion in the
general public as some people can travel to such institutions only to find out that they are
already filled up and they cannot be allowed to get in. This has also contributed to making
people leave their homes early so as to make sure that they get a seat/space which in most
cases affects the time they take to prepare themselves before they leave. It has also to some
institutions bending the laws by allowing a few extra people to get in out of sympathy for the
time they took to travel and law enforcement officers being unaware of this as they cannot
remotely monitor the number of people in these institutions.

## AIM
To make a mobile application that can be used by the general public to reserve spaces in
institutions that have a limited population and also to report non-compliance.

## OBJECTIVES
* Registered users should be able to login

* Unregistered users should be able to create accounts

* Logged in users should select an institution category

* Users should be able to reserve a spot
* Return a unique reservation if there is space and tell users if there is no space
* Users should be able to report non-compliance acts observed
